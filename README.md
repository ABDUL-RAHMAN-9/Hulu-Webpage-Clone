A high-fidelity landing page section focused on the Hulu Live Sports experience. This project features a smart auto-sliding tab system, cinematic background transitions, and a fully responsive grid system designed to mimic the premium feel of modern streaming platforms.


###  Key Features

    - Smart Auto-Toggle Tabs: An intelligent JavaScript-driven system that automatically cycles through Live Sports, Breaking News, and Biggest Events every 3 seconds.

    - Cinematic Transitions: Utilizing CSS ease-in-out transitions to create smooth cross-fading background images whenever a tab changes.

    - User-Centric Logic: Manual clicks automatically override and reset the auto-slide timer, ensuring a seamless user experience.

    - Precision Responsiveness: A mobile-first design architecture using CSS Grid (Auto-fit) and Flexbox to ensure the layout remains perfect from 4K monitors to small smartphones.

    - Modern UI Elements: Custom hover effects, glassmorphism-inspired containers, and normalized asset scaling to fix common layout bugs.

### Technologies Used

    Semantic HTML5: Structured for high accessibility and SEO performance.

    Advanced CSS3: Leveraged for custom animations, responsive typography (clamp), and complex grid layouts.

    Vanilla JavaScript: Lightweight, efficient logic for DOM manipulation, event handling, and state management.
